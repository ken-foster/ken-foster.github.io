<h2>The Death Metal Detector</h2>
<h1>Naive Bayes & Heavy Metal Culture</h1>

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_metal">
Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music...played with techniques such as...deep growling vocals; aggressive, powerful drumming, featuring double kick and blast beat techniques... 
<b><u>The lyrical themes of death metal may include slasher film-style violence, political conflict, religion, nature, philosophy, true crime and science fiction.</u></b>

Death Metal lyrics have a certain edge to them above and beyond what Ozzy Osbourne was doing in the 70s. 
I suspected that Death Metal might use a unique and detectable "language" even when the subject of a song is something 
other than a horror movie synopsis.<br><br>

Based on this hypothesis, I built The Death Metal Detector. It's a Complement Naive Bayes machine learning model, 
trained on TF-IDF transformed data on over 200,000 songs. This "scores" the brutality of the lyrics you provide on a scale from 0% to 100%!<br><br>

Try it out below! Copy/paste lyrics from your favorite songs, metal or not, or come up with your own gutteral incantations and see how <b><i>brutal</i></b> they are!
