<h2>The Death Metal Detector</h2>
<h1>Naive Bayes & Heavy Metal Culture</h1>

I'm gonna assume already know what Heavy Metal is. 
If you're a fan, then you probably also know about Death Metal. If not...<br><br>

<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_metal">
Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking...
<b><u>The lyrical themes of death metal may include slasher film-style violence, political conflict, religion, nature, philosophy, true crime and science fiction.</u></b>

Fans know that Death Metal lyrics have a certain edge to them above and beyond what Ozzy Osbourne was doing in the 70s. 

The animated comedy show Metalocalypse contained a lot of satire on how these lyrics can be controversial to the point of absurdity.

The frontman of the titular band would delight in hearing about horrific events, commenting his catchphrase with a grin, "That's pretty brutal."

<br><br>

I had a suspicion that Death Metal might use a unique and detectable "language" even when the subject of a song is something other than a horror movie synopsis.

With that hypothesis in mind, I developed a text analysis model you can try out yourself below. <br><br>

My model identifies classic Death Metal staples like Cannibal Corpse or Morbid Angel as having a +95% "brutality" score, as well as more recent acts like Archspire. Classic heavy metal like Ozzy or Iron Maiden usually scores in the 60-80% range. 
Still more brutal than say, the Rolling Stones but less so than their extreme metal successors. Non-metal acts like Taylor Swift will barely move the needle.
