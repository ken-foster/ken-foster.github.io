<p><strong>Sentiment Analysis: TextBlob vs. TensorFlow</strong><br />
These days, there are sentiment analysis tools that work right out of the box, but how well do they work? An analysis shows that a relatively simple neural net can outperform a tool like TextBlob, and require only a couple hours of training.</p>

<p><strong>Labor Economics: The Value of an Associate’s Degree after the GFC</strong><br />
Before the Great Financial Crash of the late 2000s, an Associate’s degree was a viable, low-cost option with a measurable wage premium. Read this analysis to see how that changed.</p>

<p><strong>Master’s Capstone Project: Assistance Amounts in Rapid Re-Housing</strong><br />
Some families who experience homelessness in Los Angeles receive financial assistance with paying rent. Some organizations spend more per family than others, and for my master’s capstone project I modeled how they decide how much to spend.</p>

<p><strong>NCES Data Repository</strong><br />
The National Center for Education Statistics publishes a wealth of data on education each year, but the tables are nowhere near as convenient or accessible as say, the Census Bureau API. I created a convenient, tabular repository on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kfoster150/avg-cost-of-undergrad-college-by-state">Kaggle</a> on the average cost of college.</p>

<p><strong>MemeToaster</strong><br />
This is a <a href="https://github.com/ken-foster/MemeToaster#readme">Discord bot</a> project I started learn about application programming and web hosting. I also wanted to create something entertaining I could use to bring together my long-distance friends</p>

<h2 id="professional-experience">PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE</h2>
<h3 id="lionsgate-entertainment">Lionsgate Entertainment</h3>
<p>I was Senior Product Analyst for the Direct-To-Consumer presence of <strong>Starz</strong>, a subsidiary of Lionsgate at the time. My day to day included…</p>

  <li>Supporting operationalized A/B testing with our product development team. I acted as the main point-of-contact for traffic projections, data QA, and in-depth interpretation of experiment results.</li>
  <li>Using experiment design, statistical modeling, and machine learning to parse out how different nudges, like autoplay or the images we used as key art, affected user behavior</li>
  <li>Programming automated data pipelines to deliver real time insights to stakeholders through intuitive dashboards, using SQL, Python &amp; Matillion on the backend and Tableau on the user side.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="southern-california-edison">Southern California Edison</h3>
<p>While studying for my Master’s degree, I interned with the Audit Analytics team at <strong>Southern California Edison</strong>, a public utility company serving 15 million customers. There, I…</p>
<ul>
  <li>Revamped methods to detect trends in payments to outside vendors</li>
  <li>Piloted automated process in Python for near-duplicate detection in invoice documentation, allowing for higher throughput in auditing and alleviating need for custom data parsing</li>
  <li>Presented process results to direct supervisor and VP of Risk Management, concisely summarizing image and text processing methods, emphasizing effectiveness and efficiency</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="people-assisting-the-homeless">People Assisting The Homeless</h3>
<p>Before returning to school, I was a data specialist for <strong>People Assisting the Homeless</strong>, a homeless services agency in Los Angeles. While I was there, I…</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensured data we sent to the city of Los Angeles and to the federal Housing and Urban Development office was accurate, so that policy-makers and stakeholders can make sound decisions.</li>
  <li>Developed my skills in data programming with Python, SQL, and R, to gain better insights into agency spending and client outcome trends.</li>
  <li>Lead a team of associates for all data reporting and accuracy projects. Examples include ad-hoc report requests, compliance audits, and archive management.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other">Other</h3>
<p>I’ve got a pretty interesting and diverse background outside of my work as an analyst. Ask me about my time with…</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Milken Institute</strong>, an internship where I helped put on their 2021 Global Conference.</li>
  <li><strong>The U.S. Census Bureau</strong>, where I was an enumerator for the 2020 Census. I joined because I wanted to learn, at the most elemental level, how data essential to policy decisions is gathered</li>
  <li><strong>Knott’s Berry Farm</strong>, the Southern California theme park. I worked through my undergrad as a technician for their live shows. I love live music, so this was a fun way to pay for college.</li>
