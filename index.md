## Portfolio
### Econometrics
**The Value of an Associate's Degree after the GFC**<br>
*Regression Analysis*<br>
Before the Great Financial Crash of the late 2000s, an Associate's degree was a viable, low-cost option with a measurable wage premium. Read this analysis to see how that changed.

**Master's Capstone Project: Assistance Amounts in Rapid Re-Housing**<br>
*Regression Analysis / Exploratory Data Analysis*<br>
Some families who experience homelessness in Los Angeles receive financial assistance with paying rent. Some organizations spend more per family than others, and for my master's capstone project I modeled how they decide how much to spend.

### Machine Learning
**Sentiment Analysis: TextBlob vs. TensorFlow**<br>
*Sequential Neural Network / Text Embedding Model*<br>
These days, there are sentiment analysis tools that work right out of the box, but how well do they work? An analysis shows that a relatively simple neural net can outperform a tool like TextBlob, and require only a couple hours of training.

### Dashboards & Data Visualization
**The Billboard Hot 100 Artist Explorer**<br>
*Tableau / SQL*<br>
I love music that is twice as old as I am, and love learning about the musicians that created it. So, I created a dashboard to give me a quick outline of when an artist had their first hit and when they hit peak popularity using data from the Billboard Hot 100 chart. Currently updated through 2021.

**The Death Metal Detector**<br>
*Naive Bayes / TF-IDF*<br>
Writing a heavy metal song? Use modern technology to ensure it's sufficienty brutal for your discerning audience. If for some odd reason you aren't a fan of metal, I'll show you how you to design your own genre detector that will practically run on a toaster using publicly available data.

### Independent
**NCES Data Repository**<br>
The National Center for Education Statistics publishes a wealth of data on education each year, but the tables are nowhere near as convenient or accessible as say, the Census Bureau API. I created a convenient, tabular repository on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kfoster150/avg-cost-of-undergrad-college-by-state) on the average cost of college.

**MemeToaster**<br>
This is a [Discord bot](https://github.com/ken-foster/MemeToaster#readme) project I started learn about application programming and web hosting. I also wanted to create something entertaining I could use to bring together my long-distance friends

  

## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
### Starz Entertainment
I was Senior Data Analyst for the Direct-To-Consumer presence of **Starz**, a subsidiary of Lionsgate at the time. My day to day included...
- Supporting operationalized A/B testing with our product development team. I acted as the main point-of-contact for traffic projections, data QA, and in-depth interpretation of experiment results. 
- Using experiment design, statistical modeling, and machine learning to parse out how different nudges, like autoplay or the images we used as key art, affected user behavior
- Programming automated data pipelines to deliver real time insights to stakeholders through intuitive dashboards, using SQL, Python & Matillion on the backend and Tableau on the user side.
  
### Southern California Edison
While studying for my Master's degree, I interned with the Audit Analytics team at **Southern California Edison**, a public utility company serving 15 million customers. There, I…
- Revamped methods to detect trends in payments to outside vendors
- Piloted automated process in Python for near-duplicate detection in invoice documentation, allowing for higher throughput in auditing and alleviating need for custom data parsing
- Presented process results to direct supervisor and VP of Risk Management, concisely summarizing image and text processing methods, emphasizing effectiveness and efficiency

### People Assisting The Homeless
Before returning to school, I was a data specialist for **People Assisting the Homeless**, a homeless services agency in Los Angeles. While I was there, I...
- Ensured data we sent to the city of Los Angeles and to the federal Housing and Urban Development office was accurate, so that policy-makers and stakeholders can make sound decisions.
- Developed my skills in data programming with Python, SQL, and R, to gain better insights into agency spending and client outcome trends.
- Lead a team of associates for all data reporting and accuracy projects. Examples include ad-hoc report requests, compliance audits, and archive management.

### Other
I’ve got a pretty interesting and diverse background outside of my work as an analyst. Ask me about my time with…
- **The Milken Institute**, an internship where I helped put on their 2021 Global Conference.
- **The U.S. Census Bureau**, where I was an enumerator for the 2020 Census. I joined because I wanted to learn, at the most elemental level, how data essential to policy decisions is gathered
- **Knott’s Berry Farm**, the Southern California theme park. I worked through my undergrad as a technician for their live shows. I love live music, so this was a fun way to pay for college.
