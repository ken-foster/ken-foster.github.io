## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
### Southern California Edison
Most recently, I interned with the Audit Analytics team at **Southern California Edison**, a public utility company serving 15 million customers. There, I…
- Revamped methods to detect trends in payments to outside vendors
- Piloted automated process in Python for near-duplicate detection in invoice documentation, allowing for higher throughput in auditing and alleviating need for custom data parsing
- Presented process results to direct supervisor and VP of Risk Management, concisely summarizing image and text processing methods, emphasizing effectiveness and efficiency

### People Assisting The Homeless
Before returning to school, I was a data specialist for **People Assisting the Homeless**, a homeless services agency in Los Angeles. While I was there, I...
- Ensured data we sent to the city of Los Angeles and to the federal Housing and Urban Development office was accurate, so that policy-makers and stakeholders can make sound decisions.
- Developed my skills in data programming with Python, SQL, and R, to gain better insights into agency spending and client outcome trends.
- Lead a team of associates for all data reporting and accuracy projects. Examples include ad-hoc report requests, compliance audits, and archive management.

### Other
I’ve got a pretty interesting and diverse background outside of my work as an analyst. Ask me about my time with…
- **The Milken Institute**, an internship where I helped put on their 2021 Global Conference.
- **The U.S. Census Bureau**, where I was an enumerator for the 2020 Census. I joined because I wanted to learn, at the most elemental level, how data essential to policy decisions is gathered
- **Knott’s Berry Farm**, the Southern California theme park. I worked through my undergrad as a technician for their live shows. I love live music, so this was a fun way to pay for college.

## INDEPENDENT PROJECTS
### NCES Data Repository
The National Center for Education Statistics publishes a wealth of data on education each year, but the tables are nowhere near as convenient or accessible as say, the Census Bureau API. I’m creating a convenient, tabular repository starting with a [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kfoster150/avg-cost-of-undergrad-college-by-state) on the average cost of college.

### MemeToaster
This is a [Discord bot](https://influencermarketinghub.com/discord-bots/) project I started in order to...
- Learn how to program an application, not just a single script (note: I accomplished this goal)
- Learn about web hosting, specifically on Amazon Web Services (Did this too. [My bot is currently live!](https://github.com/ken-foster/MemeToaster#readme))
- Create something entertaining I could use to bring together my long-distance connections
